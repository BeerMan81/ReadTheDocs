**OriginTrail is building first Purpose-built Protocol for Supply Chains
Based on Blockchain.**

This repository contains a work-in-progress code for a network node.
Please have in mind that code is still **in early alpha version**
developed mostly as a quick proof of concept and although main features
will work, there are many limitations.

We expect **Test Network** release to be available by the end of Q2 2018
as a beta of our protocol, while **Main Network** is scheduled for Q3
2018. For further information about our roadmap please see our
`website`_ for more detailed development roadmap.
